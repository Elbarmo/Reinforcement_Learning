# Reinforcement_Learning
My exercises while learning Reiforcement Learning. I use as a guide the lectures from [David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&index=1&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ). While viewing the lectures I came up with execises to practice the teachings in the lecture, so I decided to implement them.
